            <p>Before partaking the course, I always thought that I would study to 
                be a great, reliable designer who knows how to code, how to put things 
                together technically and deliver. Deliver what the client wants, what 
                the client needs and tend to every client’s beck and call. I wanted a 
                job, and I want to do the job to the best of my ability. To simply deliver 
                content without thinking too much about it myself.

            </h2>
            <p>As a child, I had thought of myself as an aspiring designer who loved design, 
                or at least, my perceived idea of design. My love for design started from an 
                illustrator's stand point. I've always enjoyed drawing, painting, thinking of 
                ideas and making things look appealing to the eyes. This illustration background 
                led me to view design as simply being pretty illustrations, graphics, models in 
                technical practices. It was purely an aesthetic concept. But never had I considered 
                that design could be <i>SO MUCH MORE</i> than what meets the eye. It’s about 
                <text class="myname">
                ideas</text>, <text class="myname">concepts</text>, <text class="myname">solutions</text>.
                
                It lies in the process of reflection, ideation, evaluation, research and 
                analysis. It’s about expressions and relationships between the designer and the user. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The next few works showcase my ever expanding exploration, growth and love of design 
                through an antithetic approach; <text class="myname">constraint</text> and <text class="myname">limitations</text>. </p>

            <p class="concept">
                From an illustrator's eyes, the artist could do everything. The artist can make vast worlds 
                and universes to no limit but one's imagination. However, this idea of expansivity which I 
                used to regard as an designer's best tool is actually their weakness. For without challenge, 
                there lacks inspiration.
                <br>
                Facing challenges where I'm in a position that limits my tools, medium and even time, I found 
                more ideas that I would have never thought of with just a blank canvas. This idea of <i>empty space</i>
                was explored in the project RED.

                    <text class="HRED"> <b>RED</b></text> has allowed me to explore the idea of space, and how we, as designers, 
                    can use it in meaningful ways. I would never have thought of negative space as a part of design. When the
                    concept of Ma was introduced to my creative practice, I spent a great majority of working on this piece constructing
                    the idea of what Ma is and how it applies to my life as a design student. I looked into how it influences my intrerests,
                    culture, life and even practice. Within the documentation provided, I discovered that Ma is a:
                    <br><br><text class="HRED"><i>
                    pause <b>not for the sake of pausing</b>, 
                    but a pause for <b>reflection and growth</b>. It encourages the discovery of authentic meaning and purpose in the quieter, 
                    "emptier" moments, which aren't empty at all, but rather, create space for more purposeful thoughts and ideas.</i></text> <br><br>
                    Evaluating how I created this piece, I want to use this understanding of Ma as a tool where space is both a design element 
                    and as a means to emotionally and meaningfully interact with. I've learned to implement this concept to my daily life; and 
                    have taken its values of negative space to my workspace too. I found that this enabled me to think clearly and produce more 
                    thoughtful ideas and works. <br> <br>
                    This assignment reminded me also of my culture, and the importance of including my cultural background to diversify future projects.

                <text class="ouli"> <b>Chinese Boxes</b></text> is an interactive environment which represents the concept of 
                <text class="ouli"><i>oulipo</i></text> and how freeing a creative piece can be when the rules are tightened. This environment involves the 
                representation of a series of constraints and procedures that fit inside each other like <i>Chinese boxes</i>, and
                only by indulging yourself in these layers of constraints, you will find deeper creative substance which opens an 
                entirely new perspective. 
                <br><br>
                This is about accepting and embracing the rules and the constraints. In practice, designers will encounter a lot of 
                limits, rules, constraints. A designer's most powerful tool is to utilise these and embrace them as a part of their 
                work. Far too often in my practice I feel incredibly stressed out and frustrated with the limitations of my assignments, 
                whether it be time, word count or the lack of technical knowledge. I want to stop viewing these as elements that halt my
                practice, but rather, I want to grow to be a designer who can use the commonly associated 'negatives' as tools, and truly 
                stand out by utilising them. I felt that by practicing this concept of learning how to work harmoniously with the limits, 
                perhaps even highlighting them, in <text class="ouli">Chinese Boxes</text>, I was able to truly create a simple, yet  
                conceptually rich interactive.
                <br><br> My take away from this project is when you embrace the constraints, your work almost becomes like a gemstone; 
                it shines bolder and more robust when under pressure. This is the designer I aspire to be. <br><br><br>

                <br><br>
                This piece aims to share an experience for what it truly is, staying true to Masao Shiki's concept of haiku: sharing a 
                direct moment of life and capturing the spirit of waking up on an Australian winter morning. <br><br>
                This project has pushed and inspired me to contribute a part of myself and my experiences not just to the digital environment 
                scene but the perhaps contemporary literary haiku scene too. I am able to showcase a piece of my story of who I am and what 
                matters to me as a designer. This sharing of myself has also allowed me to value my own story and contributions to my future 
                projects, and encourage me to add a touch of my creativity in future client work.

                Practicing the limiting nature of these projects inspired by both Oulipo and Haiku has really placed me in a position as a 
                designer that understands and gains a much deeper appreciation for these ideas. To no longer see limits and rules as bindings 
                or vices that hold back creativity, but as tools for inspiration and creation for much more meaningful projects and maybe even 
                carry their values with me not just in my professional practice (whether with clients or personal projects), but also through 
                life to simply make the most of what is seen as difficult or impossible. They have also encouraged me to add my 
                own ideas and creativity in projects, as my own thoughts, experiences, ideas and creativity are unique and valued, that they are 
                what makes me the designer I am.

            </h2> 
            <p class="bon">
                In my journey of discovering and expressing my creativity through concepts around limits and constraints, I 
                wanted to share my own stories. But more importantly, I want to use my newly acquired concepts to raise awareness on
                important issues that live in real life. <br><br>
                <text class="HLove"> <b>The Twisted</b></text> is a 3D environment based on a hint fiction piece written myself.
                It is a part of a digital triptych which I call the <i>LOVE: the beautiful, the real and the twisted</i> series. 
                The Twisted aims to raise awareness on sexual assault, deconstruct assault and manipulation, the constraining nature of abusive relationships  
                as well as the stereotypes of <i>dating simulators</i> and the issues that surround them, encouraging the player to
                raise questions about the specific medium. <br></p>
                <!-- <img src="img/hint fic.jpg" class="hintf"> -->
            <p class="bon">
                Using a hint fiction piece, whilst extremely short, poses a greater, more complex story, much like media portrayal of
                sexual assault. It serves as a reflection of how the media focuses on the moments of assault over the victim and survivors'
                recovery journey; which can be extremely traumatising for a survivor to go through.<br><br>
                I want this piece to tell the world that sexual assault is extremely suffocating, dangerous and incredibly difficult to recover from. 
                I aimed to strip the abusers of their humanity and support for victims and survivors of sexual assault. I want the world to know that
                sexual assault can happen to anybody, no matter the gender and identity. I want the world to know that it's not the fault of the victim 
                but rather for the abuser to be held accountable for their crimes. That we shouldn't be siding with the perpetrator, but instead, support 
                the affected.

            <p class="bon">
                <text class="HLove"> <b>The Real</b></text> is a clicker game which grounds itself on the concept of love which takes
                effort. This was made to depict the idea that love is not a feeling, but an action.
                This part of the project was one that I really wanted to make. I strongly value the idea of all things involving Love 
                takes genuine effort. Even with my love for design, I consistently have to keep turning up and producing content. I have
                 to make the effort to remain inspired and actively seek creativity. This piece is a visual ode to myself, my efforts in 
                 creating my projects, with continuous refinement partnered with my love and passion for design, can create not just rewarding
                 things, but also meaningful and sentimental ideas and lessons.<br></p>

                To wrap up on my journey, I made a project called <b class="HLove">The Beautiful</b>, the final piece of the <b class="HLove">Love</b> series.
                It was the most challenging assignment I've made as it included a foreign language, <i>Javascript</i>. Learning a bit of a 
                new language made me feel a step closer to becoming a super technically familiar designer. I felt I grew a little by 
                learning a language that wasn't offered in the course. Of course, I also felt that like this assignment, I will 
                forever be continuously growing in my practice (whilst also continuing to redefine my skills, much like pruning and trimming 
                a bonsai).
